# HydraFlask

## To Install:
1. In whatever environment you plan on using HydraFlask, run `python3 -m pip install hydraflask`.
2. To generate a file structure, run `python3 -m hydraflask <dirname> <file>`, where `<dirname>` is the name of the top-level directory the application will create and `<file>` is the location of the model file (documentation on writing model files is planned).
3. Your app should be initialized now, you should be able to move into the top-level directory that was created, make a new environment, and install dependencies with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` and then run your app with `python3 app.py`.
4. Profit
5. ???
